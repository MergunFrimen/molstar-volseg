# Mol* Volumes & Segmentations

Mol* Volumes & Segmentations is a [Mol*](https://molstar.org) extension which adds the support for large scale volumetric data & their segmentations. Building on the existing Mol* ecosystem, Mol* allows seamless integration of biomolecular data ranging from whole cell 3D reconstructions from light miscroscopy, all the way down to atomic level.
